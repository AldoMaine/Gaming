# Borderland 2 Gun Damage Calculator App

...documentation in development....  

## Introduction
A basic Python app using the TkInter library to compute the damage per second (DPS) for guns in Borderlands 2. While I agree that field testing a gun is the best way to see if it works for you, sometimes I end up with several guns and need a quick way to compare them. 

## How to use. 
* Download 'BL2 Damage Calculator.exe' to your PC. 
* Double click 'BL2 Damage Calculator.exe' to start. (takes 15-20 seconds to start)  
* Enter gun data from BL2 weapon card.  UI is designed to follow order of parameters seen on BL2 weapon cards.  
* Click  'Calculate' to view predicted damage for each target type in UI.  
* Click 'Save' to add this gun and it's damage results to a comparison table.  The comparison table will be shown in a new window.   
* Add other guns to the table as needed.   
* In the compare window you can 'Export' the data to a csv file.  
* You can also 'Import' previously exported gun data from a csv file for comparison to a newer gun.
